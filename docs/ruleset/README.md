# AsyncAPI Spectral Ruleset

ParserJS has some built-in Spectral rulesets that validate AsyncAPI documents and inform about good practices. Those are:

- [Core Ruleset](./core-ruleset.md) - validates the overall structure of AsyncAPI documents (applied for each version, starting from `2.0.0`).
- [Recommended Ruleset](./recommended-ruleset.md) - verifies good practices within AsyncAPI documents structure (applied for each version, starting from `2.0.0`).
- [v2 Core Ruleset](./v2-core-ruleset.md) - validates the overall structure of AsyncAPI version `2.x.x` documents.
- [v2 Recommended Ruleset](./v2-recommended-ruleset.md) - verifies good practices within AsyncAPI version `2.x.x` documents.

> **Note**
> The described rulesets are similar to the one found at https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral/blob/develop/docs/reference/asyncapi-rules.md. They have been adapted under the rights of the Apache-2.0 license.
