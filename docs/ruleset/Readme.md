# AsyncAPI Spectral Ruleset

ParserJS has some built-in Spectral rulesets that validate AsyncAPI documents and inform about good practices. The distinctions are:

- [Core Ruleset](./core-ruleset.md) - the core ruleset, which validates the overall structure of the specification (applied for each version, starting with `2.0.0`).
- [Recommended Ruleset](./recommended-ruleset.md) - the recommended ruleset, which verify good practices when writing the specification structure (applied for each version, starting with `2.0.0`).
- [v2 Core Ruleset](./v2-core-ruleset.md) - the core ruleset, which validates the overall structure of the `2.x.x` specifications.
- [v2 Recommended Ruleset](./v2-recommended-ruleset.md) - the recommended ruleset, which verify good practices when writing the `2.x.x` specifications structure.
